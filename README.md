Processor and analysis codes are stored.

ILC Soft version : v02-01-02

For files which relate to processor in /src or /include, I added comments "Added by Seidai". You can find some modified points from this comments. Modified fies are the following : BBbarAnalysis.hh QQbarMCOperator.hh TreeWriter.hh TreeStructures.hh QQbarProcessor.hh BBbarAnalysis.cc QQbarMCOperator.cc QQbarProcessor.cc TreeWriter.cc

/run is the folda for running processor. There is a steering file and it'll be copied and generate steering files respect with each sample files by gen_steering.py. And such steering files are submitted to server by bsub.py.

/analysis is the folda for analysis.
