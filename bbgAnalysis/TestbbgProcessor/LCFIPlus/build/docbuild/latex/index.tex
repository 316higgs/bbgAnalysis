\subsection*{L\-C\-F\-I\-Plus documentation}

The L\-C\-F\-I\-Plus package provides a collection of algorithms for performing vertex finding, jet clustering, and flavor tagging in the context of a future linear collider, such as the I\-L\-C and C\-L\-I\-C.

This package extends the features originally developed by {\tt L\-C\-F\-I\-Vertex}.

This project is part of {\tt I\-L\-C\-Soft}.
